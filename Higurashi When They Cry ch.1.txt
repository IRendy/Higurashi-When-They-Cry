Higurashi When They Cry - Ch.1 Onikakushi

...Somebody has been apologizing for a while now.

I wonder what she's apologizing for.
It felt wrong to eavesdrop, so I tried to ignore it.

It had been a while since I'd last went to the city. I only returned to attend the funeral of a relative.
Even though I'd lived there until last month, I found the bustle of the city to be overwhelming.

Those skyscrapers and the multi-lane roads.
The melodious cacophony of the crosswalk.
Even the campaign speeches blaring in front of the station left nostalgic.

The place where I live now isn't nearly as lively.

There's only the chirping of locusts and the babbling of brooks.And the cry of the higurashi-the evening cicadas.

Rather than making me feel lonely, that quietness had begun to instill a sense of serenity.

There is nothing where I'm living now.
I don't just mean there aren't any burger joints.
There aren't even vending machines.
No music stores, no restaurants... and no arcades.
Even an ice cream parlor would be unlikely.

The nearest town has some stuff like that, but it's an hour away by bike.

But come to thinke of it, it wasn't really a big deal.

There were musci stores and arcades and ice cream parlors, but it wasn't like I ever hung out at any of them.

I had lived in the city for ten years and never once been to an ice cream parlor.

...I should have gone at least once.
It's only now that I'm starting to regret that a little.

...Somebody is still apologizing.

Who is she apologizing to?
She's apologized so much, so just forgive her already.
There's no reason anyone should ever need to apologize so much.

I started to feel a bit annoyed at whoever was refusing to forgive her.

No matter how bad the mistake, there's noting that can't be forgiven.
There's no such thing as an irreparable mistake.
You just need to be more carefull next time.

...She's still apologizing, even now.

Then... has she really done something that can't be fixed?

I have no idea what she's done, but if it can't be fixed, then that's all the more reason to forgive her.
No matter how much she apologizes, nothing will change.

But even so, she keeps apologizing in such a heartbreaking voice...

Hey, you. The one she's apologizing to...
Why don't you just go ahead and forgive her?

She's apologizing... in such a pathetic voice...

"Keiichi, we're almost there. Wake up."
I was finally roused from my nap by my father's prodding.
It seemed the train had reached its final stop.

We'd spent hours riding everything from the bullet train to the local routes.
It was hard to believe that the landscape beyond the window and the city I was in half a day ago were in the same country.
No...that they were even from the same era.

From there, we'd take a car deeper into the mountains.

Past where the dense forest encroaching on the mountain road suddenly opened up...

There, where I live now. Hinamizawa.

Even though we were approaching summer, the morning air still had a frigid bite.
Although, in exchange, you could fill your lungs up with crisp, clean air.

Flipping open the window, I was greeted with a verdant expanse.
Noting but trees.
The neighboring house was far away on the other side, so I was probably the only open enjoying that view and that air.


I filled my lungs with another deep breath.
Since I started living in Hinamizawa, I learned that even air had its own taste.

I quickly finished getting ready for school and headed downstairs for breakfast.

My mother was the only one there. My father was nowhere to be seen.
He was probably up working until the early morning.

Dad had a rather unconventional job as a painter.
It's such a laid-back profession.
Get up when you want, sleep when you want, and work when you want.

I was so jealous of that easy-going lifestyle, I even wrote for school that I wanted be a painter when I grew up.
Dad was ecstatic about that.
It was just because it looked easy. I'd never tell him that, though.

Mom laid breakfast out on the table.
Seaweed, pickled vegetables, raw egg, and grilled salmon.

My mom was such a good cook, it was scary.
A perfect, immaculate, ideal breakfast.
Unlike my dad, who didn't even know the meaning of the word "schedule", my mom never squandered any time or effort.

She hummed a little tune as she brought over the miso soup. It seemed like she was in a good mood today.

"I'm so happy you've been waking up early since we moved here, Keiichi."
"If I don't wake up early, I won't have time to eat breakfast."
I thought I was being cute, responding with a wise-crack after being praised for being good.

"Full bowl of rice? Or will half be enough?"
"Pile it on"
First, I savored the steaming hot rice with the seaweed. After that, I covered it with the egg.
Between bites of rice, I enjoyed the crunch of the pickles.
Not bad at all. Excellent, as usual.

Watching me clean my plate, Mon gave me a warm smile.
"I'm so happy you haven't skipped breakfast ever since we moved here, Keiichi."

I was not a morning person when we lived in the city.
I slept right until the last minute before school and rarely ate breakfast.

Boycotting the breakfast Mom made me each morning... that was probably the only way I could protest being forced to attend cram school.

...I guess that was what you'd call my rebellious phase.
I wouldn't so much as look at the breakfast she woke up early every day to make.
If I could go back in time, I'd slap myself.

Mindful of the time, Mom rushed me along with a wide grin.
"Isn't it about time to meet up with Rena-chan? Hurry, hurry."
Mom really seemed to enjoy the fact that her son was going to school with a gril.

Rena is one of my classmates.
She really loves looking after people, coming to meet me every day without fail.

The way I looked at it, a guy my age walking to school with a girl was just lame.
But, well, keeping a classmate waiting for me every day wouldn't be very considerate.

...Seriously, though, how long does Rena wait there for me every morning...?

Taking one last gulp of miso soup, I raced for the door.

"Please thank Rena-chan for the pickles~!"
Come ti think of it, those pickles weren't store-bought, were they?
...If I'd known that, I would have savored them a bit more!
"Mornin!"

"Keiichi-kun~! Good morning~!"
Her cheerful greeting was as fresh as the morning itself.
"You're always so early. You should try sleeping in sometime."

"If I sleep in, I'll keep you waiting."
...She's so conscientious, and such a good person.
"If that ever happens, I'll just leave you behind."
"Keiichi-kun, you're so cold. I wait for you all the time..."
"I'll leave you in the dust. Without looking back."
"Why are you so mean? ...Why?"
Rena had a slightly troubled look on her face.
Toying with her was rather fun because of how quickly her mood changed.

"I'kidding. I'd wait for you."
With those words, Rena seemed to relax.
Her face flushed bright red.

"...Ah...Th-Thank you..."
"I'd wait forever until you came, Rena. No matter how long."
"...Ah-ah, ah... ...For... Forever..."
Rena turned bright red, stram rising from her head as her brain short-circuited.
She's especially weak to this sort of talk.
It's quite rare to find someone this fun to tease.
